# payrollMaSys

payrollMaSys is a LAN-based payroll management system developed using **Java (JDK 23)** and **MySQL 8.0**. The system automates employee attendance tracking, payroll computation, and payroll-related reporting to replace traditional Excel-based payroll processes of a printing service company in Pasig City, Philippines.

## Overview

The system manages employee records, attendance data, payroll calculations, and reporting through a centralized database. It integrates biometric attendance data (using ZKFingerForPayrollMS) and applies automated computations to generate accurate payroll results while reducing manual workload.

The software follows the Verification and Validation V-Model of the Software Development Life Cycle, making it suitable for well-defined and modular system requirements.

## Key Features
- Automated payroll computation
- Attendance management with biometric integration
- Role based user access and authentication
- Employee record management (E-201 files)
